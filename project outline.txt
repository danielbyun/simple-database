project outline

1) simple database where users can log in and view contents that people have submitted (kinda like reddit but way simpler)
    - java (JSP, Servlet, JDBC)
    - mysql
2) members side of tingz
    - table
    - DAO, DTO, Controller, Command
    - user should supply with their desired userId, userPw, and their display name
        - create
        - page for them to join
        - page for them to login
        - page for them to edit their credentials
3) their content side of tings
    - board
    - DAO, DTO, Controller, Command

3 controllers? (one to just redirect users, one for the members, one for the board)

* once a user is logged in, the user doesn't need to supply their credentials to write individual boards
* but when viewing a board, the edit (along with delete) button should only be visible when the credentials match (use sessionId)

** in the future:
- have a reply button that creates a board that's indented (not like manso's weird ass design with the stupid ass arrows)
- user can reply to the original post, or reply to the reply to the original post

^ or create a v2.0 for that? lol

idcheck
- use ajax
    - so i can give the user feedback on that same page without redirecting by using jsp

^^ instead of manso's transitionsl XMLHttpRequest() method, try using either fetchAPI or jquery


when user is logged in
HOME    VIEW    WRITE   LOGOUT

when not logged in
HOME    VIEW    SIGNUP  LOGIN

member side of tings
1) join feature
2) login feature

board side of tings
1) write feature
2) editing feature (edit [aka update], delete)
    * only when user is logged and the post belongs to the user
3) listing feature

- implemented the registering feature
    - add some sort of checks for userId, userPw? (making sure it's long enough for the password, etc)
- implemented the login feature (with session)
    - nice to haves:
        1) if the userId does exist, tell the user that it's just the password that's incorrect
        2) if the userId doesn't exist, just say everything is messed up

11/10/2018
- member edit feature
    - the user should be able to view his/her profile (only viewable to the user himself/herself)
        - edit (aka update), delete (if they want, delete all the content they posted)

- start creating boards (content)
